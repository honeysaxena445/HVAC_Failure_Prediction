Project Summary: HVAC Failure Prediction System
This project simulates a predictive maintenance system for HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) equipment using machine learning. I generated synthetic data mimicking real-world sensor readings such as air temperature, power consumption, vibration, and time since last maintenance.

Using Random Forest Classifier, I trained a model to predict whether a unit will fail in the next 24 hours, achieving high accuracy (~90%). The project includes:

Data generation and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using seaborn/matplotlib

Model training and evaluation

Confusion matrix and classification report

Visual insights that aid decision-making for timely maintenance

This model supports smart O&M strategies aligned with platforms like Xempla, helping reduce unplanned downtime and improving asset reliability.
